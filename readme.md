**Disclaimer:** Phase is far from feature complete in terms of language features and class availability for Haxe. 
Phase is strongly focusing on being the compiler for [alphaTab](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/). If you would like
to use Phase in your project feel free to open an issue in this repository asking for assistence.
